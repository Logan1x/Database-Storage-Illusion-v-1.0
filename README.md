# Database-Storage-Illusion-v-1.0
This is a python script made with the help of framework Flask, which does a very simple job for us of getting user inputs via a html form and dealing with it's storage in a CSV file making it as a database illusion. This CSV file can be easily viewed in spreadsheets to actually look as if we're dealing with real-time database.

## Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

4. Click on the link generated at terminal or copy it and paste the url in your desired browser and you're all done.
